<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span
style='font-size:36.0pt;line-height:115%'>Clue-Less!</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Cambria","serif"'>OBJECTIVE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. Boddy — apparently the victim of foul play — is found in
one of the rooms of his mansion. To win, you must determine the answers to
these three questions: Who done it? Where? And with What Weapon? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Cambria","serif"'>SETUP</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the beginning of a game of Clue-Less, all connected
players will be prompted to select their character. In traditional Clue, Ms.
Scarlett would always go first, but for fairness the first player to move will
be selected at random. Once all of the connected players have selected their
character, each player will be dealt three cards (one Suspect, one Room, and
one Weapon), and the game will begin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Cambria","serif"'>GAME</span></b><span style='font-size:20.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Cambria","serif"'> <b>PLAY</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Moving
Your Token</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On each turn, try to reach a different room of the mansion. Every
player’s first move must be to a Hallway that is adjacent to their starting
Room. A player in a Room may move to any adjacent Hallway that is not already
occupied by another player, or if a player is currently in a Corner Room, they
may choose to use a Secret Passage. If you were moved to the current Room by
another player making a Suggestion, you may, if you wish, stay in that room and
make a Suggestion rather than moving. If all adjacent Hallways are blocked and
you are not currently in a Corner Room, you may not move this turn, but you may
make an Accusation if you so choose. A player which begins their turn in a
Hallway must move one of the Rooms connected by that hallway and make a
Suggestion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Secret
Passages</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rooms in opposite corners of the mansion are connected
by Secret Passages. If you’re in one of these rooms at the start of your turn,
you may, if you wish, use a Secret Passage instead of moving to a Hallway. Moving
through a Secret Passage will place your token in the Room located in the
opposite corner of the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Making a
Suggestion</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as you enter a room, you will be prompted to make a
Suggestion. By making Suggestions throughout the game, you try to determine— by
process of elimination— which three cards are in the confidential Case File
envelope. To make a Suggestion, select a Suspect and a Weapon, both of which
will be moved to the Room you just entered. You have now made the Suggestion
that the crime was committed in that Room, by that Suspect, with that Weapon. Example:
Let’s say that you’re Miss Scarlet and you enter the Lounge. You will then be
prompted to select a Suspect, Mr. Green, for instance, and a Weapon, the Wrench
perhaps. When you’re satisfied with your Suggestion, you will click Confirm.
Both the Suspect and the Weapon will then me moved to the Room which you are
currently occupying, and all players will be shown “Player 1 has suggested the
crime was committed in the Lounge by Mr. Green with the Wrench.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember two things:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You must be in the Room that you mention in your Suggestion.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Be sure to consider all tokens— including spare Suspects and
including yourself!— as falling under equal suspicion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Proving a
Suggestion True or False</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as you make a Suggestion, your opponents, in turn, try
to prove it false. The first to try is the player below you on the Player’s
List. This player looks at his or her cards to see if one of the three cards
you just named is there. If the player does have one of the cards named, that
card will be shown to you and no one else. If the player has more than one of
the cards named, he or she will select just one to show you. If that opponent
has none of the cards that you named, then the chance to prove your Suggestion
false passes, in turn, to the next player in the rotation. As soon as one
opponent shows you one of the cards that you named, it is proof that this card
cannot be in the envelope. End your turn by checking off this card in your
notebook. (Some players find it helpful to mark the initials of the player who
showed the card.) If no one is able to prove your Suggestion false, you may
either end your turn or make an Accusation now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Making an
Accusation</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you think you’ve figured out which three cards are in
the envelope, you may, on your turn, make an Accusation and select any three
elements you want. I.E., “I accuse (Suspect) of committing the crime in the
(Room) with the (Weapon).” You will then be shown the three cards that are in
the Confidential Case File envelope. In a Suggestion, the Room you name must be
the Room where your token is located. But in an Accusation, you may name any
room. Remember: You may make only one Accusation during a game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>If Your
Accusation Is Incorrect</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any one of the cards that you named is not inside the
Case File:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>All three cards return to the Confidential Case File envelope.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You may make no further moves in the game, and therefore cannot
win, but you do remain involved in the investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You do continue to try to prove your opponents’ Suggestions
false.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Your token will still be moved into the various Rooms when other
players make Suggestions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:115%'>Winning</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You win the game if your Accusation is completely correct—
that is, if you find in the Confidential Case File envelope all three of the
cards that you named. When this happens, all players are shown the cards and
the game has ended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Special Notes About Suggestions:</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you make a Suggestion, you may, if you wish, name one or more of the cards that
you hold in your own hand. You might want to do this to gain information or to mislead
your opponents.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
may, if you wish, make a Suggestion and an Accusation on the same turn.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
may make only one Suggestion after entering a particular room. To make your next
Suggestion, you must either enter a different room or, sometime after your next
turn, re-enter the room that you most recently left. You may not forfeit a turn
to remain in a particular room. But if you’re trapped in a room because your
opponents are blocking the exits, you must remain there until an exit is
unblocked and you can move out of the Room.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
may make a Suggestion that includes a Suspect or Weapon that’s already in your Room.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
yours was the Suspect transferred, you may, on your next turn, do one of two
things:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Move from the Room in one of the usual ways
OR Make a Suggestion for that room.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>If you decide to make a Suggestion, you do
not move that turn.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is no limit to the number of Suspects or Weapons that may be in one Room at one
time.</p>
